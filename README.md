# patternsStudy

In this repository , I am going to push my notes of design patterns and build projects to learn them. I want more of a project based learning to really get them in my head hence the repository. This repository might also help others who don't know where to start, a direction.

# Week 1 : Strategy Pattern and Observer pattern 
Source : Head First Design Pattern for the study material.
Project: Perfect — that’s an excellent way to build pattern intuition.

### **Project: Battle Arena Simulator**

You're building a **Battle Arena** simulator. Here's what it should support:

1. There are **multiple types of characters**: Warrior, Archer, Mage.
2. Each character can **perform an attack**, but the attack style or effectiveness can differ.
3. The Arena should allow you to **add or remove characters** during runtime.
4. You also want the ability to **log events** (e.g., "Archer attacked for 15 damage!") to different destinations:

   * Console
   * A file
   * Or maybe a future UI dashboard
5. You should be able to **simulate a battle round**, where each character takes a turn to attack.

#### **Optional Challenge Add-ons**:

* Add character health and simulate elimination when health reaches zero.
* Introduce buffs/debuffs or power-ups that change attack behavior.
* Add an "arena announcer" that gives commentary.
